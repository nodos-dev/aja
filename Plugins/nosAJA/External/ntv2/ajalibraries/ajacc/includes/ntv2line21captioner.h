/**
	@brief	Instances of me can encode two ASCII characters into a "line 21" closed-captioning waveform.
			Conversely, my CNTV2Line21Captioner::DecodeLine class method can decode a "line 21" waveform to the two characters it contains.

			In either use case, I assume a 720-pixel line (e.g. Standard Definition "NTSC"), and the closed
			captioning is represented by an EIA-608 waveform. I do not handle other forms of closed captioning
			transmission (e.g., EIA-708, digital ancillary packets, etc.).

	@note	This implementation only handles conversion to/from 8-bit uncompressed ('2vuy') video.

	@note	This implementation makes a simplifying assumption that all captioning bits are 27 pixels wide.
			The actual bit duration should be (H / 32), which for NTSC video is 858 pixels / 32 = 26.8125 pixels per bit.
			This difference should be within the tolerance of most captioning receivers.
			(In PAL, the line width is 864 pixels, which is exactly 27.0 pixels per bit.)
